    Some MIT projects I have worked throughout my course of studies at MIT Sloan.
    1) Naive long/short trading strategy with specific twists to improve returns and tackle non-stationary issue. 
    2) Text classification with multi-categories/lables.
    3) Online/real-time content recommendation using multi-armed Bandits models.
